            I have recently been awarded a PhD in Aerospace/Flight Robotics from the Technical University of Madrid.<br>
            I have a lot of experience in the field of Nonlinear Control, gained through both my academic studies and professional work.<br>  
            Throughout my academic journey—from my bachelor's to master's and PhD degrees—I focused extensively on control systems, flight dynamics, and the design of nonlinear control algorithms, including adaptive and robust approaches.<br>
            Professionally, over the past six years, I have been working on modifying industrial autopilot (Micropilot, UAV Navigation, Pixhawk, etc.) control loops and designing ground control system software.<br>
            My doctoral thesis involved implementing thrust vector control on flap vanes in a hexa-ducted fan UAV to stabilize its attitude.<br>
